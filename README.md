# Venture AI MVP Specification

Empowering Businesses with AI-Integrated Idea Sharing for Venture Capital Readiness

## Architecture

This is an illustration of the Venture AI MVP, mapping out the end-to-end flow of data through the system. Each component of the illustration is clearly labeled.

## APIs and Methods

- API Routes for Web Client:
  - `/api/business_ideas`
    - GET: Retrieves a curated list of business ideas filtered by industry and investment potential.
    - POST: Allows users to submit new business ideas to the platform.
  - `/api/user`
    - GET: Retrieves user information based on session ID.
    - POST: Allows users to create a new account on the platform.
- Endpoints for Other Clients:
  - `class IdeaProcessor.processIdea(idea)`
    - A method to process a submitted business idea using AI algorithms for analysis and recommendation.

## Data Model

Here's a simplified textual representation of the flow for the data model diagram:

[Business Idea] <-- [Submitted By] <-- [User]
[Business Idea] <-- [Belongs To] <-- [User]
[User] <-- [Created By] <-- [Account]
[User] <-- [Has] <-- [Session ID]
[Business Idea] <-- [Processed By] <-- [AI Algorithms]

## Challenge

The current process of sharing and developing business ideas is often disorganized and lacks efficient collaboration, making it difficult for businesses to prepare for venture capital investment.

## Solution

Our AI-Integrated Business Development Platform aims to streamline the process by providing a centralized platform for sharing, collaborating, and developing business ideas, while also integrating AI-powered tools to help businesses identify potential investment opportunities.

## Users

The platform will primarily target small to medium-sized businesses looking to prepare for venture capital investment, as well as venture capitalists and investors looking to discover new investment opportunities.

## Risks

Technical Risks:
- Performance: Ensuring the platform can handle a large number of users and ideas without experiencing significant performance issues.
- Security: Protecting user data and ensuring the platform is secure from potential cyber threats.
Non-Technical Risks:
- User Adoption: Ensuring users find value in the platform and continue to use it over time.
- Investor Interest: Attracting venture capitalists and investors to the platform to discover new investment opportunities.

## Safeguards

- Performance: Implementing load balancing and caching mechanisms to improve performance.
- Security: Regularly updating security measures and conducting vulnerability assessments.

## Infrastructure

- Branching and Merging: We will use a GitHub flow, where each team member will create a branch for their work and merge it into the main branch once it's ready.
- Deployment: We will use a continuous integration and deployment process, where changes are automatically deployed to a staging environment for testing before being released to the production environment.
- Data Population: We will use a combination of user-generated content and pre-populated data to populate the platform with ideas and collaboration opportunities.

## Testing

We will use automated testing tools, such as Jest, to test the platform's functionality and ensure it meets our quality standards.
